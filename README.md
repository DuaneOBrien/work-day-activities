## What is a Work Day?

Work Days are primarily for doing cleanup on the various issues adn PRs in the [TODO Group GitHub organisation](https://github.com/todogroup). We've found that if we don't regularly set aside time to do these tasks, they never get done.

Here is a list of things that we expect people to work during the WDA meetings. The list is sorted by TODO project contribution level, in descending order:

### *"I'm new" tasks*

* 📩 Add [OSPONews content for next month](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/main/newsletter#how-to-contribute-to-osponews)
* 🧑‍💻 Capure [new OSPO Job Descriptions](https://landscape.todogroup.org/guide#ospo-career-path)
* 📌 Add [new tech & open source conferences](https://github.com/todogroup/presentations/blob/main/2022-tech-events.md) to the 2022 list

### *"I'm in a working group" tasks*

* 📝 Work on [WIP 2022 TODO Guides](https://github.com/todogroup/todogroup.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aguide)

## Calendar invites

Calendar invites are sent via TODO Mailing list ([Community](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeU0YGM_IJ6gY8E5IIiwXKD_FZi3kAVc4E9_-3dtTDyKMSjdA/viewform) and General Member) and notified at [TODO Slack general channel](https://slack.todogroup.org/)

If you'd like to be on the invite for the next event, please ping Ana Jimenez (TODO PM) on the TODO Group Slack. She'll make sure you receive the reminder.

## Process

1) Read this README documentation
2) Go to [2022 WDA List](https://github.com/todogroup/work-day-activities/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A2022)
3) Choose the section you wish to work on today (guides, ospology, whitepapers, etc)
4) Go to the dedicated repo and check the open issues available

Typically people will send event reminders via Slack and email in advance of the event, so you can start thinking of what you'd like to work on.

On the work day itself, we all gather in the Zoom meeting and touch base, sharing what we plan to work on and asking anyone whether they'd like some help with their chosen tasks. We hang out on the Zoom (creating breakout rooms if needed), typing away on our tasks, asking questions, and generally hanging out productively.

## Join us!

Work days are a great way to see and make friends in TODO Group while also contributing to the community. It's very casual but also productive. Come be a part of the fun!
